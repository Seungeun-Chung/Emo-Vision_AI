# Emo-Vision_AI

2023.03. ~ 2023.08.

We worked on a project to create software and hardware that identifies non-verbal expressions such as facial expressions that are important during conversation, classifies them in the form of emojis, and transmits them in the form of vibration patterns to both arms of a visually impaired person.

Below is the poster for submission to the Global Capstone Design Competition (ASCC), and we won second place in the Capstone Design Competition held at Kookmin University and won awards in international competitions.
